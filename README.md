# Random_Assign_Generator

This code is for COMPSCI345/SOFTENG350 at the University of Auckland. It is used for assigning a randomly selected colour code to a student for their Assignment 2.

How to Use:
1. make sure you have a CSV file include the students ID (with a column named "SIS User ID"). p.s. you can download the file in Canvas, via the Grade tab, by exporting the grades.
2. Run the code, and add the student CSV and a colour list CSV provided in the "Data" folder.
3. click the "Generate" button, and the resulting CSV file would be located in the "Result" folder.

Note: the colour table is referenced from https://gist.github.com/lunohodov/1995178, which include 213 RAL standard colours. The resulting CSV file has two columns, student ID and Colour Hex code.
